=====================================================

As discussed in previous chapters, creativity can be a powerful tool for managing conflicts in the workplace. In this chapter, we will explore how to apply creativity in conflict management effectively.

Preparation for Creative Conflict Management
--------------------------------------------

Before applying creativity in conflict management, there are some essential steps that individuals and teams should take to prepare themselves fully:

* Clarify the conflict: Before attempting to resolve a conflict, it is essential to understand what the conflict is about and why it is occurring. Individuals should take the time to identify the root causes of the conflict and build a clear understanding of the issues involved.
* Adopt a proactive approach: Instead of waiting for conflicts to happen, teams and individuals should adopt a proactive approach towards conflict management. This involves developing systems and procedures for identifying and addressing conflicts quickly and effectively.
* Build a culture of openness and trust: A culture that emphasizes openness, honesty, and trust can help individuals and teams to communicate effectively and work collaboratively toward resolving conflicts creatively.
* Foster a creativity mindset: Creativity is a mindset, and individuals and teams should develop an open and flexible attitude towards problem-solving. This involves encouraging experimentation, taking risks, and embracing a growth mindset.

Steps to Apply Creativity in Conflict Management
------------------------------------------------

Applying creativity effectively in conflict management involves several key steps:

1. Define the problem: Begin by defining the problem clearly and concisely. Identifying the root cause of the conflict will help focus attention on the right areas to find a solution.
2. Ideate: Once the problem has been defined, encourage individuals and teams to generate as many creative ideas as possible, even if they seem far-fetched or unrealistic.
3. Evaluate: After generating a range of ideas, evaluate each one on its own merit. Determine which ideas have the potential to be implemented and which should be discarded.
4. Develop a plan: Once an idea has been identified and evaluated, develop a concrete plan to implement it. This plan should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
5. Implement the plan: Implement the plan and monitor its progress. Evaluate its effectiveness and make adjustments as necessary.
