3. Choose a neutral facilitator to lead the exercise.
4. Set the stage: Explain the problem and challenge participants to come up with a unique solution.
5. Introduce random stimuli: Provide participants with a set of unrelated objects, images, or words, and ask them to find associations between the stimuli and the problem at hand.
6. Let the synectics session begin: Have participants use the associations they identified to generate new and unique solutions to the problem.
7. Debrief: Discuss the outcomes of the synectics session and ask participants to reflect on what they learned and what they would do differently in a similar situation.
