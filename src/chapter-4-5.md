Introduction
------------

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of synectics as a powerful technique in conflict management. Synectics is a creative problem-solving approach that encourages individuals to make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas or concepts. By applying synectics principles and methods, organizations can foster innovation, break through stalemate situations, and find novel solutions to workplace conflicts.

Understanding Synectics
-----------------------

Synectics is based on the belief that creative solutions emerge from combining diverse perspectives and ideas. It involves thinking beyond traditional boundaries, making unconventional connections, and embracing the power of metaphorical thinking. Synectics draws inspiration from various fields, including psychology, design thinking, and systems theory.

### Key Principles of Synectics

* Diverse Input: Synectics encourages the inclusion of individuals with different backgrounds, experiences, and expertise to generate a wide range of ideas.
* Metaphorical Thinking: The use of metaphors helps individuals transcend literal interpretations and find new insights and connections.
* Suspension of Judgment: During the idea generation process, participants are encouraged to suspend judgment, allowing for wild and unconventional ideas without immediately evaluating their feasibility.

* Incorporate Metaphorical Thinking: Encourage participants to use metaphors and analogies to explore novel perspectives and connections.
* Combine and Refine Ideas: Facilitate a collaborative process where ideas can be combined, built upon, and refined to create innovative solutions.

### Evaluation and Implementation

* Evaluate Feasibility: After the idea generation phase, evaluate the feasibility and potential impact of each solution before moving forward.
* Select Solutions Collaboratively: Involve all stakeholders in the selection of solutions, ensuring buy-in and ownership.
* Develop Action Plans: Create clear action plans outlining the steps necessary to implement the selected solutions effectively.
